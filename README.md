# Group Planner
Group Planner is a simple calculator for you to plan a party or activity. It allocates num_person of People into NUM_GROUP of groups, that each group has MAX_PEOPLE_IN_GROUP People.

People will make acquaintance and will not be in a group with People they have acquainted. The allocation will run for MAX_STAGE of stages.

Too many stages will result in no answers since People might have all known each other.
